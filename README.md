# Bootstrap Share Icons

Add social sharing icons to the bottom of posts using [Font Awesome
icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons) . 

Font Awesome styles and font files are *not* provided by this plugin; they have
to be present in your theme or made available by another plugin. 

The plugin also does not provide any other styles. It is up to users to define
styles for the `.bootstrap-share` class and its child elements.

The options for sharing icons are:
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google Plus
* LinkedIn
* Pinterest

All options are on by default, but they can be disabled through a settings page
that appears in the dashboard under ``Settings.''

Use recent version of WP, PHP etc. for best results.

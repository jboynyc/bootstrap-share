## Description

Add sharing icons to the bottom of posts using Font Awesome. Font Awesome
styles and font files are *not* provided by this plugin; they have to be
present in the your theme or made available by another plugin. The plugin also
does not provide any styles. It is up to users to define styles for the
`.bootstrap-share` and child elements.

The options for sharing icons are:
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google Plus
* LinkedIn
* Pinterest

All options are on by default, but they can be disabled.
